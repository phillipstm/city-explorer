**Author**: Teresa Phillips
**Version**: 1.0.10 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

When a user enters a valid location in the input field and clicks the "Explore!" button, the lattitude and longitude will be displayed with a api map display.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

Create a **Tello** Board

Navigate to City Explorer **Trello** Board <https://trello.com/b/Ajj9Cbac/module-2-city-explorer> Select "Show Menu", "...More" and copy "Copy Board". If you would like your site to be public change the settings from private to public.

Create a new repo in **GitHub** initialized with no files.

Use **create-react-app** to set up a new React application named city-explorer in your local projects directory.

Connect your GitHub repo to your local repo using the instructions in GitHub.

Add a `.gitignore` file with React configurations, including ignoring of `.env`.

Create a **package.json** file with all dependencies and any associated details related to configuration. As **Axios and Bootstrap**.

Deploy to **Netlify**.

Create a pull request of your basic ***React app** to your main branch. Merge to main branch.

**Procure a LocationIQ** free-tier account. From the Dashboard, navigate to your API Access Tokens page. View and Update the existing token, to change the label to "City Explorer".

**IMPORTANT**: Add your deployed Netlify app url as an HTTP Referrer to your API token settings. This is necessary to revnt any unauthorized use of your token. And add localhost while testing from your development environment.

Create an **.env** file: Your API key goes here for local development. Make sure this is in your **.gitignore**.

Add your **API key** to your Netlify deployment. Under "Site settings">"Build & deploy" > "Environment", add "Edit variables" to add your API key, giving it the same name you used in your local.env file.
